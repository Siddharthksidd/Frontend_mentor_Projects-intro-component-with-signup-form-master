## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have praticaly experienced the form and its styling properties along with javascript validation in this project.

### Continued development


I would like to make my own form so this could be used as a default template and also can be include in further projects where a form is needed to collect data like in contact form or a sign up form

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for better understanding of the CSS properties.
