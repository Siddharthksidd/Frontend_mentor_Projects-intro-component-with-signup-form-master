## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I have praticaly experienced the form and its styling properties along with javascript validation in this project.

### Continued development

I would like to make my own form so this could be used as a default template and also can be include in further projects where a form is needed to collect data like in contact form or a sign up form

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for better understanding of the CSS properties.
